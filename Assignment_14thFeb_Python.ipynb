    "Q1. What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python. Why is the threading module used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1: Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a lightweight sub-process that can be executed independently and shares the same memory space as the main process. Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism and improve the efficiency of programs that involve tasks that can be executed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called the \"threading\" module. The threading module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads in Python. It simplifies the process of working with threads by providing functions and classes to create, start, stop, and synchronize threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is used in Python because it provides a higher level of abstraction and a more convenient API for working with threads compared to lower-level modules such as \"thread\" or \"multiprocessing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Write the use of the following functions:\n",
    "- activeCount: The `activeCount()` function is used to return the number of Thread objects currently alive. It returns the count of all threads, including the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- currentThread: The `currentThread()` function is used to return the current Thread object, corresponding to the caller's thread of execution. It is often used to get a reference to the current thread for various operations or to identify the current thread in a multi-threaded program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- enumerate: The `enumerate()` function is used to return a list of all Thread objects currently alive. It returns a list of Thread objects that are currently running or alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain the following functions:\n",
    "- run: The `run()` method is the entry point for the thread's activity. It defines the code that will be executed when the thread is started. It is typically overridden in a subclass to implement the specific behavior of the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "- start: The `start()` method is used to start a thread's activity. It initializes the thread and calls the `run()` method. The `start()` method should only be called once for each thread object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- join: The `join()` method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. It blocks the calling thread until the thread on which it is called terminates. It allows threads to synchronize their activities and ensures that all threads complete their execution before the main thread exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- isAlive: The `isAlive()` method is used to check if a thread is still alive. It returns `True` if the thread is currently running or alive, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Write a Python program to create two threads. Thread one must print the list of squares, and thread two must print the list of cubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {i}: {i**2}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i**3}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "    thread1.start()\n",
    "    thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    thread1.join()\n",
    "    thread2.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above program, two threads are created using the `Thread` class from the threading module. The `target` argument specifies the function to be executed by each thread. The `print_squares` function prints the squares of numbers from 1 to 5, and the `print_cubes` function prints the cubes of numbers from 1 to 5. The threads are started using the `start()` method\n",
    "\n",
    ", and the `join()` method is used to wait for the threads to complete their execution before exiting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. State the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Improved performance: Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, which can lead to faster execution times and improved system performance. It enables better utilization of CPU resources and can speed up the execution of time-consuming operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responsiveness: Multithreading enables concurrent execution of tasks, making the application more responsive to user interactions. It prevents blocking of the main thread and allows background tasks to run independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource sharing: Threads in the same process share the same memory space, allowing efficient sharing of data and resources. This can simplify communication and data sharing between different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "- Complexity: Multithreading introduces additional complexity into the program design and implementation. Coordination and synchronization between threads must be carefully managed to avoid issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased resource consumption: Multithreading can consume more system resources, such as CPU and memory, due to the overhead associated with thread creation, management, and synchronization. Improper use of threads can lead to resource contention and reduced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difficult debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to the inherent non-deterministic behavior of thread execution. Issues such as race conditions and deadlocks can be hard to reproduce and diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deadlock: Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. It occurs when two or more threads acquire locks or resources in a way that each thread is waiting for the release of a resource that is held by another thread in the deadlock state. As a result, none of the threads can proceed, leading to a deadlock situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Race condition: A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data or resources concurrently, and the final outcome of the program depends on the order or timing of their execution. It arises when the behavior of a program is dependent on the relative timing of events and the order of execution of instructions by multiple threads. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable and incorrect results, as the outcome of the program becomes non-deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions are concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs. They can lead to program failures, incorrect results, and system instability. Proper synchronization and thread management techniques need to be employed to avoid or resolve these issues in multithreaded programming."
