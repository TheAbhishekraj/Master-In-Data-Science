    "**Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:You can create a Bokeh plot using Python code by importing the `bokeh.plotting` module and using the `figure()` function. The `figure()` function takes a number of arguments, including the size of the plot, the title, and the axes. For example, the following code creates a simple line plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bokeh.plotting as bp\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "fig = bp.figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=300, title=\"Simple Line Plot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "fig.line(x, y, line_width=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "bp.show(fig)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will create a line plot with the x-axis values in the list `x` and the y-axis values in the list `y`. The plot will have a width of 400 pixels and a height of 300 pixels. The title of the plot will be \"Simple Line Plot\". The line will have a width of 2 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are glyphs in Bokeh, and how can you add them to a Bokeh plot? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In Bokeh, glyphs are the visual elements that are used to represent data in a plot. There are a number of different types of glyphs available, including line glyphs, scatter glyphs, and bar glyphs. To add a glyph to a Bokeh plot, you can use the `glyph()` function. The `glyph()` function takes a number of arguments, including the type of glyph, the data to be plotted, and the style of the glyph. For example, the following code adds a scatter glyph to a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bokeh.plotting as bp\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "fig = bp.figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=300, title=\"Scatter Plot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "fig.scatter(x, y, marker=\"circle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "bp.show(fig)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will create a scatter plot with the x-axis values in the list `x` and the y-axis values in the list `y`. The points in the plot will be represented by circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How can you customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: You can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot by using the `xaxis()`, `yaxis()`, `title()`, and `legend()` functions. The `xaxis()` and `yaxis()` functions can be used to customize the axes of the plot. The `title()` function can be used to customize the title of the plot. The `legend()` function can be used to customize the legend of the plot. For example, the following code customizes the appearance of a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bokeh.plotting as bp\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "fig = bp.figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=300, title=\"Scatter Plot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# customize the axes\n",
    "fig.xaxis.axis_label = \"x-axis\"\n",
    "fig.yaxis.axis_label = \"y-axis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# customize the title\n",
    "fig.title.text = \"My Custom Title\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# customize the legend\n",
    "fig.legend.location = \"top_left\"\n",
    "\n",
    "bp.show(fig)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will customize the appearance of the scatter plot created in the previous example. The axes will be labeled \"x-axis\" and \"y-axis\". The title of the plot will be \"My Custom Title\". The legend will be located in the top left corner of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A Bokeh server is a web server that can be used to serve Bokeh plots. Bokeh plots served by a Bokeh server can be updated in real time. This means that you can change the data in a Bokeh plot and the plot will be updated automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How can you embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Here are the steps on how to embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Flask or Django application.\n",
    "Import the bokeh.embed.components module.\n",
    "Create a Bokeh plot.\n",
    "Get the HTML components for the Bokeh plot.\n",
    "Add the HTML components to the web page or dashboard.\n",
    "Here is an example of how to embed a Bokeh plot into a web page using Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "from bokeh.embed.components import components\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "    fig = figure(plot_width=400, plot_height=300, title=\"Simple Line Plot\")\n",
    "    fig.line(x, y, line_width=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    script, div = components(fig)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return render_template(\"index.html\", script=script, div=div)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will create a simple line plot and embed it into a web page. The web page can be accessed by opening the following URL in a web browser: http://localhost:5000/\n",
    "\n",
    "The same steps can be used to embed a Bokeh plot into a web page using Django."
