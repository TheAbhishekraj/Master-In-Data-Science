    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1: When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the Exception class or one of its subclasses. The Exception class serves as the base class for all the exceptions in Python, and using it as the base class provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance and Compatibility: Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that the custom exception inherits all the standard functionalities and behaviors of an exception. It provides access to important attributes and methods like the error message, traceback information, and the ability to propagate exceptions. By using the Exception class as the base, the custom exception can be seamlessly integrated into the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consistency and Clarity: By inheriting from the Exception class, the custom exception follows the established conventions and best practices of exception handling in Python. It communicates to other developers that the custom exception is meant to be treated as an exceptional situation that should be handled separately. This consistency makes the code more readable, maintainable, and easily understandable by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customization and Specialization: The Exception class provides a foundation for customizing and specializing the behavior of the custom exception. Developers can add additional attributes, methods, or behaviors specific to the custom exception's purpose while still leveraging the core functionalities provided by the Exception class. This allows for fine-grained control and flexibility in exception handling based on the specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions ensures compatibility, consistency, and customization in exception handling, promoting better code organization and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Write a Python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans2: Here's a Python program to print the Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import builtins\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    print(' ' * indent + exception_class.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above program utilizes the built-in `builtins` module, which contains all the built-in exceptions in Python. The `print_exception_hierarchy` function recursively prints the exception hierarchy starting from the `BaseException` class. The indentation is adjusted based on the level in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling `print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)`, the program will display the complete exception hierarchy in Python, including all the built-in exception classes and their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans3: The `ArithmeticError` class in Python is a base class for errors that occur during arithmetic operations. It provides a common base for specific arithmetic-related exceptions. Some errors defined in the `ArithmeticError` class include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ZeroDivisionError`: This error occurs when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero. It is raised by the interpreter when a zero division is encountered. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, dividing `10` by `0` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. The exception is caught by the `except ZeroDivisionError` block, which handles the error by printing an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `OverflowError`: This error occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value. It is raised by the interpreter when an overflow condition is encountered. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    large_number = sys.maxsize +\n",
    "\n",
    " 1\n",
    "except OverflowError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Number exceeds the maximum representable value\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, adding `1` to the maximum representable integer value (`sys.maxsize`) causes an overflow, resulting in an `OverflowError`. The exception is caught by the `except OverflowError` block, which handles the error by printing an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why is the LookupError class used? Explain with examples: KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4: The `LookupError` class in Python is a base class for exceptions that occur when a lookup or indexing operation fails. It provides a common base for specific lookup-related exceptions. Two examples of exceptions derived from the `LookupError` class are `KeyError` and `IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `KeyError`: This exception is raised when a dictionary key is not found during a lookup. It occurs when you try to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    value = my_dict['c']\n",
    "except KeyError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Key not found in the dictionary\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we are trying to access the key `'c'` in the dictionary `my_dict`. Since the key does not exist in the dictionary, a `KeyError` is raised. The exception is caught by the `except KeyError` block, which handles the error by printing an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IndexError`: This exception is raised when an invalid index is used to access an element in a sequence, such as a list or a string. It occurs when you try to access an index that is out of range. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    value = my_list[3]\n",
    "except IndexError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Index out of range\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we are trying to access the element at index `3` in the list `my_list`. Since the list has only three elements with indices `0`, `1`, and `2`, accessing index `3` raises an `IndexError`. The exception is caught by the `except IndexError` block, which handles the error by printing an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5: `ImportError` is an exception that is raised when an imported module or package cannot be found or loaded. It occurs when there is an issue with importing a module or resolving its dependencies. The `ImportError` class is a base class for all import-related exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3.6 and later versions, the `ImportError` class has been renamed to `ModuleNotFoundError` for better clarity and specificity. `ModuleNotFoundError` is a subclass of `ImportError` and provides more detailed information about the import error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError` occurs, it indicates that the Python interpreter was unable to locate the module specified in the import statement. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The module or package is not installed: If the required module or package is not installed on the system, attempting to import it will raise an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorrect module or package name: If the name specified in the import statement does not match the actual module or package name, the interpreter will fail to locate it and raise an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Circular imports or dependency issues: If there are circular imports or dependency conflicts between modules, it can lead to import errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle import errors, you can use `try-except` blocks and catch the specific exception class (`\n",
    "\n",
    "ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`) to provide appropriate error handling or fallback mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6: Exception handling is an important aspect of writing robust and reliable Python code. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be specific in exception handling: Catch exceptions at the appropriate level of granularity. Use specific exception classes to handle specific types of errors. Avoid catching generic exceptions like `Exception` unless necessary, as it can mask unexpected errors and make debugging difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use multiple `except` blocks: If you need to handle different exceptions differently, use multiple `except` blocks to catch and handle each exception separately. This allows you to provide customized error handling based on the specific exception type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `finally` block for cleanup: Use the `finally` block to specify code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is useful for performing cleanup operations like closing files, releasing resources, or restoring the program state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Avoid bare `except` clauses: Avoid using bare `except` clauses without specifying the exception type. It can catch unexpected exceptions and hide programming errors. Instead, catch specific exceptions or use a hierarchy of exception classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Log exceptions: Use a logging framework to log exceptions and their associated traceback information. This helps in debugging and understanding the cause of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Propagate or raise exceptions when necessary: If you cannot handle an exception at a particular level, it is better to propagate or raise the exception to a higher level of the program where it can be appropriately handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Follow the EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) principle: Python follows the EAFP principle, which encourages writing code that assumes the existence of valid data or conditions and catches exceptions if they occur. This approach can lead to cleaner and more concise code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Document exceptions: Document the exceptions that your functions or methods can raise. This helps other developers understand the expected behavior and handle exceptions correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust and maintainable Python code that handles exceptions effectively and provides better error handling and recovery mechanisms."
