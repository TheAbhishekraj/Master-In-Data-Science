    "**Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"r\"** - Opens the file for reading.\n",
    "* **\"w\"** - Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "* **\"a\"** - Opens the file for appending. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "* **\"r+\"** - Opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "* **\"w+\"** - Opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "* **\"a+\"** - Opens the file for both reading and appending. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `r` mode is the most common mode of opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of the file. The `w` mode allows you to write to the file. The `a` mode allows you to append to the file. The `r+` mode allows you to read and write to the file. The `w+` mode allows you to read and write to the file, and it will overwrite the file if it exists. The `a+` mode allows you to read and append to the file, and it will create the file if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `close()` function is used to close a file in Python. It is important to close a file after you are finished using it because it frees up the resources that were used to open the file. If you do not close a file, it will remain open until the program terminates. This can cause problems if you are using a large file, because it will use up memory and CPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then\n",
    "close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def create_file():\n",
    "  file = open(\"data_scientist.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "  file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")\n",
    "  file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "def read_file():\n",
    "  file = open(\"data_scientist.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "  content = file.read()\n",
    "  print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "  create_file()\n",
    "  read_file()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will create a file called `data_scientist.txt` and write the text `I want to become a Data Scientist` to the file. The code will then close the file and open it again to read the content of the file. The content of the file will be printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read()` function reads the entire contents of a file and returns it as a string. The `readline()` function reads a single line from a file and returns it as a string. The `readlines()` function reads all of the lines from a file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use the `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()` functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def read_file():\n",
    "  file = open(\"data_scientist.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "  content = file.read()\n",
    "  print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "  line = file.readline()\n",
    "  print(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "  lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "  print(lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "  read_file()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will read the contents of the file `data_scientist.txt` and print them to the console. The `read()` function will print the entire contents of the file. The `readline()` function will print the first line of the file. The `readlines()` function will print all of the lines of the file, one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, here are the answers to your questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The `with` statement is used to ensure that a file is closed properly after it is used. The `with` statement automatically closes the file when the code block that uses the file is finished executing. This prevents the possibility of a file being left open, which can cause problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the `with` statement and `open()` together is that it is a **more concise and less error-prone way** to ensure that a file is closed properly. Here is an example of how to use the `with` statement and `open()` together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data_scientist.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "  file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is equivalent to the code in Q3, but it uses the `with` statement to ensure that the file is closed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `with open(\"data_scientist.txt\", \"w\") as file:` statement opens the file `data_scientist.txt` in write mode. The `as file:` part of the statement assigns the file object to the variable `file`.\n",
    "* The `file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")` line writes the text `I want to become a Data Scientist` to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the code block that uses the `with` statement is finished executing, the file is automatically closed. This is because the `with` statement ensures that the `close()` method is called on the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some of the benefits of using the `with` statement and `open()` together:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is more concise.\n",
    "* It is less error-prone.\n",
    "* It ensures that the file is closed properly, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The `write()` function writes a string to a file. The `writelines()` function writes a list of strings to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use the `write()` and `writelines()` functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data_scientist.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "  file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")\n",
    "  file.writelines([\"I also want to learn Machine Learning\", \"and Natural Language Processing\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will write the text `I want to become a Data Scientist` to the file `data_scientist.txt`. It will also write the two lines `I also want to learn Machine Learning` and `and Natural Language Processing` to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")` line writes the text `I want to become a Data Scientist` to the file.\n",
    "* The `file.writelines([\"I also want to learn Machine Learning\", \"and Natural Language Processing\"])` line writes the two lines `I also want to learn Machine Learning` and `and Natural Language Processing` to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `write()` function writes a string to a file, while the `writelines()` function writes a list of strings to a file. The `writelines()` function is more efficient than the `write()` function if you are writing a large number of strings to a file.\n",
