    "Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1: In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition or error occurs, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled by the program. Exceptions provide a way to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully, allowing the program to recover or terminate gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program and are caused by factors such as invalid input, division by zero, file not found, etc. They are handled using the try-except statement. Exceptions can be caught and appropriate actions can be taken to handle the error condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax errors: Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the parsing of the code before the program execution starts. They are caused by incorrect syntax or grammar in the code. Syntax errors prevent the program from running and need to be fixed by correcting the code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions occur during the runtime of the program due to specific error conditions, while syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code due to incorrect syntax or grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans2: When an exception is not handled or caught by the program, it results in an unhandled exception. In such a situation, the program terminates abruptly, and an error message is displayed that provides information about the unhandled exception and its traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the behavior when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `divide` function attempts to divide the value `10` by `0`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. Since there is no exception handling code to catch and handle this error, the program terminates and displays an error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the example, the program execution is halted, and the error message indicates the type of exception (`ZeroDivisionError`) and the line of code that caused the exception (`line 2 in divide`). It is important to handle exceptions to prevent such unexpected terminations and provide appropriate error handling or fallback mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans3: In Python, the `try-except` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. The `try` block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the `except` block specifies the code to be executed if a specific exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `try-except` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "        print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",
    "\n",
    "divide(10, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `divide` function attempts to divide the value `10` by `0`. Since division by zero is not allowed and raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, the `try-except` block catches the exception and executes the code in the `except` block. In this case, it prints an appropriate error message: \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `try-except` statements, the program can gracefully handle the exception and continue its execution without terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain with an example:\n",
    "try and else\n",
    "finally\n",
    "raise\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `try` and `else`: The `try-else` statement is used to specify a block of code that should be executed if no exceptions occur in the preceding `try` block. The `else` block is executed only if the `try` block completes successfully without any exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `try-else`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = int(input(\"Enter another number: \"))\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `try` block attempts to divide two numbers entered by the user. If the division operation succeeds without any exceptions, the code in the `else` block is executed, which prints the result. If any exception occurs, the corresponding `except` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `finally`: The `finally` block is used to specify a block of code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations or releasing resources that need to be executed irrespective of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `finally`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = None\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # Perform some operations on the file\n",
    "    print(file.read())\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: File not found.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    if file:\n",
    "        file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `try` block attempts to open a file and perform some operations on it. If the file is not found (`FileNotFoundError`), an appropriate error message is printed in the `except` block. The `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `raise`: The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception in Python. It allows the program to raise custom exceptions or propagate built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `raise`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 18:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid age: Must be 18 or above\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Access granted\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    check_age(15)\n",
    "except ValueError as error:\n",
    "    print(str(error))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `check_age` function raises a `ValueError` exception with a custom error message if the provided age is less than 18. In the `try` block, the `check_age` function is called with an age of 15, which raises the exception. The `except` block catches the exception and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5: Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions created by the programmer to handle specific error conditions that are not covered by the built-in exceptions in Python. They are derived from the base `Exception` class or its subclasses to provide a customized error handling mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions in Python for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specific error handling: Custom exceptions allow us to define specific error conditions that are meaningful in the context of our program. By creating custom exceptions, we can catch and handle specific error scenarios with more precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code organization: Custom exceptions help in organizing and categorizing different types of errors in our code. They make the code more readable and maintainable by providing a clear distinction between\n",
    "\n",
    " different error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reusability: Custom exceptions can be reused across different parts of the code or even in different projects. They encapsulate specific error logic and can be easily incorporated into different error handling scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InvalidEmailError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, email):\n",
    "        self.email = email\n",
    "        self.message = f\"Invalid email address: {email}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def send_email(email):\n",
    "    if not \"@\" in email:\n",
    "        raise InvalidEmailError(email)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Email sent successfully\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    send_email(\"example.com\")\n",
    "except InvalidEmailError as error:\n",
    "    print(error.message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we define a custom exception `InvalidEmailError` derived from the base `Exception` class. The `send_email` function checks if the email address contains the \"@\" symbol, and if not, it raises the `InvalidEmailError` exception. In the `try` block, the `send_email` function is called with an invalid email address, and the `except` block catches the `InvalidEmailError` exception and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using custom exceptions, we can handle specific error conditions related to email validation in a more structured and meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6: Here's an example of creating a custom exception class and using it to handle an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise InvalidInputError(\"Invalid input: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except InvalidInputError as error:\n",
    "    print(str(error))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we define a custom exception class `InvalidInputError` derived from the base `Exception` class. The `divide_numbers` function performs division of two numbers but checks if the divisor (`b`) is zero. If it is zero, it raises the `InvalidInputError` exception. In the `try` block, the `divide_numbers` function is called with the arguments `10` and `0`, which raises the exception. The `except` block catches the `InvalidInputError` exception and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a custom exception class, we can encapsulate the logic and error handling specific to the invalid input scenario and provide a more meaningful error message."
