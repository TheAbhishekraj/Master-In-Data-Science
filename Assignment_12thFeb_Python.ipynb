    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1. An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It represents an error or an exceptional condition that can occur during the program's execution. Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, division by zero, file not found, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when there is a violation of the programming language's syntax rules. They occur during the parsing phase of the program and prevent it from being executed. Syntax errors are typically caused by mistakes in the code structure, such as missing colons, incorrect indentation, or using an undefined variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors are detected before the execution starts during the parsing phase. Exceptions can be anticipated and handled using exception handling mechanisms, whereas syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans2. When an exception is not handled, it leads to an abnormal termination of the program. The program execution is halted, and an error message is displayed, providing information about the unhandled exception that occurred. This can be problematic as the program does not gracefully recover from the error, and any further code after the exception may not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "print(\"This line will not be executed due to the unhandled ZeroDivisionError\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we have a `divide_numbers()` function that performs division between two numbers. In this example, `num2` is set to 0, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when the division operation is performed. Since we have not handled this exception, the program execution is interrupted, and the error message is displayed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent line that prints \"This line will not be executed\" is not executed due to the unhandled exception. Hence, it's important to handle exceptions appropriately to prevent unexpected program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans3. Python provides two main statements for catching and handling exceptions: `try` and `except`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` statement is used to enclose a block of code that might raise an exception. The code inside the `try` block is executed, and if any exception occurs during its execution, it is caught by the corresponding `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `try` and `except`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    num1 = 10\n",
    "    num2 = 0\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)  # This line is not executed\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the division operation in the `try` block raises a `ZeroDivisionError` since `num2` is 0. This exception is caught by the `except ZeroDivisionError` block, which prints an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By catching and handling exceptions, we can gracefully handle exceptional situations and prevent the program from abruptly terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4. Here's an explanation of the following constructs with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `try` and `else`:\n",
    "The `else` block is used in conjunction with the `try` block and is executed only if no exceptions occur within the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise\n",
    "\n",
    " an exception\n",
    "    num1 = 10\n",
    "    num2 = 5\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute when no exception occurs\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `try` block performs the division operation, and if no exception occurs, the `else` block is executed, which prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `finally`:\n",
    "The `finally` block is used to define a block of code that will always be executed, whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the FileNotFoundError\n",
    "    print(\"Error: File not found\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code to execute always\n",
    "    file.close()  # Close the file resource\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `finally` block ensures that the file resource is always closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is useful for performing cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing resources, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `raise`:\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception. It allows us to create and raise custom exceptions or propagate existing exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative\")\n",
    "    elif age > 120:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid age\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "    validate_age(age)\n",
    "    print(\"Valid age:\", age)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", str(e))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `raise` statement is used to raise a `ValueError` exception when the `validate_age()` function encounters invalid age values. This exception is then caught by the `except` block, which prints an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5. Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exception classes that inherit from the base `Exception` class or its subclasses. They allow us to define and handle specific exceptional situations in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions when we want to represent a specific type of exceptional condition that is not adequately covered by the built-in exception classes. By defining custom exceptions, we can provide more meaningful error messages, encapsulate complex error handling logic, and create a more structured approach to handling exceptional situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def validate_input(value):\n",
    "    if not isinstance(value, str):\n",
    "        raise CustomException(\"Invalid input: Expected a string\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    user_input = 42\n",
    "    validate_input(user_input)\n",
    "    print(\"Input:\", user_input)\n",
    "except CustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", str(e))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we define a custom exception class `CustomException` by inheriting from the base `Exception` class. The `validate_input()` function checks if the input value is a string and raises a `CustomException` if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program encounters `user_input` as an integer instead of a string, the `validate_input()` function raises a `CustomException`. This exception is caught by the `except CustomException` block, which then prints an appropriate error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions allow us to handle specific exceptional conditions in a more organized and meaningful way, enhancing the readability and maintainability of our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6. To create a custom exception class, we can define a new class that inherits from the base `Exception` class or its subclasses. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomException(\"This is a custom exception\")\n",
    "except CustomException as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e.message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we define a custom exception class `CustomException` that inherits from the base `Exception` class. The `__init__()` method is overridden to accept a custom error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we raise an instance of `CustomException` with a specific message using the `raise` statement, it triggers the exception. The raised exception is then caught by the `except CustomException` block, which prints the custom error message associated with the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating custom exception classes, we can tailor our exception handling to specific scenarios and provide more informative error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting."
