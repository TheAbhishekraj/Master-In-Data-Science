    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1: MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for dynamic schema design and easy integration with modern applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are database management systems that do not follow the traditional relational model used by SQL databases. In contrast to SQL databases, which store data in structured tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases use various data models to store and retrieve data, such as key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible Schema: MongoDB's document model allows for flexible and dynamic schemas, meaning each document can have its own structure. This flexibility is well-suited for applications where data structures evolve over time or where data has varying attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB provides built-in horizontal scalability by allowing data to be distributed across multiple servers or clusters. This makes it suitable for handling large-scale applications with high traffic and data volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Unstructured Data: If your application deals with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media feeds, log files, sensor data, or user-generated content, MongoDB's document model can handle these data types more naturally compared to rigid table-based structures of SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rapid Prototyping and Agile Development: MongoDB's flexible schema and dynamic nature make it ideal for rapid prototyping and agile development environments. It allows developers to iterate quickly and adapt their data models without the need for extensive schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time Analytics: MongoDB provides powerful aggregation and indexing capabilities, allowing for real-time analytics and data processing. It can efficiently handle complex queries and aggregations across large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is preferred in scenarios where flexibility, scalability, handling unstructured data, and rapid development are critical factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans2: MongoDB offers several features that make it a popular choice for modern applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, where data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents called BSON. Documents can have varying structures, making it easy to handle evolving or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexible Schema: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for dynamic and flexible schemas within a collection. Each document can have different fields and structures, eliminating the need for schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB supports horizontal scalability through automatic sharding, allowing data to be distributed across multiple servers or clusters. It also provides replication for high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and Querying: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single-field, compound, text, and geospatial indexes. It also provides a rich query language with support for complex queries, aggregations, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for advanced data processing and analysis. It provides a pipeline-based approach to perform data transformations, filtering, grouping, and aggregations, similar to SQL's GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. GridFS: MongoDB includes GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files and binary data, such as images, videos, or audio files. GridFS automatically divides large files into smaller chunks and distributes them across collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Replication and Data Consistency: MongoDB supports replica sets, which are self-healing clusters of database nodes. Replica sets provide automatic failover and data redundancy for increased reliability and data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Geospatial Capabilities: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data and queries, allowing you\n",
    "\n",
    " to store and query location-based information efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Security: MongoDB offers various security features, including authentication, access control, encryption, auditing, and role-based access control (RBAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and support. It also has a rich ecosystem with libraries, drivers, and tools for different programming languages and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make MongoDB a powerful and flexible database solution for modern applications that require scalability, flexibility, and efficient data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans3: To connect MongoDB to Python, you need to install the `pymongo` library, which provides a Python API for MongoDB. Here's an example code snippet to connect to MongoDB, create a database, and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create or access a database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create or access a collection\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we import the `pymongo` library and create a `MongoClient` object, specifying the connection URL. By default, MongoDB runs on `localhost` with the default port `27017`. Next, we create or access a database named \"mydatabase\" using the `client` object. Finally, we create or access a collection named \"customers\" within the \"mydatabase\" database using the `mydb` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have established a connection to MongoDB, created a database, and a collection ready to store your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4: Here's an example code that demonstrates inserting one record and multiple records into a MongoDB collection, and then printing the inserted record(s) using the `find()` and `find_one()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record_one = { \"name\": \"John\", \"email\": \"john@example.com\" }\n",
    "inserted_one = mycol.insert_one(record_one)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted ID:\", inserted_one.inserted_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records_many = [\n",
    "    { \"name\": \"Jane\", \"email\": \"jane@example.com\" },\n",
    "    { \"name\": \"Mike\", \"email\": \"mike@example.com\" },\n",
    "    { \"name\": \"Sarah\", \"email\": \"sarah@example.com\" }\n",
    "]\n",
    "inserted_many = mycol.insert_many(records_many)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted IDs:\", inserted_many.inserted_ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted record using find_one()\n",
    "result_one = mycol.find_one({ \"name\": \"John\" })\n",
    "print(\"Inserted Record (find_one()):\", result_one)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print all inserted records using find()\n",
    "result_many = mycol.find()\n",
    "print(\"Inserted Records (find()):\")\n",
    "for record in result_many:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we first establish a connection to MongoDB and access the \"mydatabase\" database and \"customers\" collection. We then insert one record using the `insert_one()` method and print the inserted record's ID. Next, we insert multiple records using the `insert_many()` method and print the inserted records' IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the inserted record(s), we use the `find_one()`\n",
    "\n",
    " method to find a single record that matches the given query (in this case, the record with the name \"John\"). We print the retrieved record using `find_one()`. We also use the `find()` method to retrieve all the inserted records and print them in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5: The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query the database and retrieve documents that match a specific criteria. It allows you to filter and retrieve documents based on various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple code example that demonstrates how to use the `find()` method to query the MongoDB database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query the database using find()\n",
    "query = { \"age\": { \"$gt\": 30 } }  # Retrieve documents where \"age\" is greater than 30\n",
    "results = mycol.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the matching documents\n",
    "for doc in results:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we first establish a connection to MongoDB and access the \"mydatabase\" database and \"customers\" collection. We define a query object that specifies our search criteria, in this case, retrieving documents where the \"age\" field is greater than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the `find()` method on the collection `mycol` and pass the query object as a parameter. This returns a cursor object that represents the result set. We iterate over the cursor using a loop and print each matching document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the code retrieves and prints all documents from the \"customers\" collection where the \"age\" field is greater than 30. You can customize the query object to include different conditions and operators to filter the results based on your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6: The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to sort the result set based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order. It allows you to control the order in which documents are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates sorting in MongoDB using the `sort()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort documents by a field in ascending order\n",
    "results_asc = mycol.find().sort(\"name\", pymongo.ASCENDING)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Documents Sorted in Ascending Order:\")\n",
    "for doc in results_asc:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort documents by a field in descending order\n",
    "results_desc = mycol.find().sort(\"name\", pymongo.DESCENDING)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Documents Sorted in Descending Order:\")\n",
    "for doc in results_desc:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we establish a connection to MongoDB and access the \"mydatabase\" database and \"customers\" collection. We use the `find()` method to retrieve all documents from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sort the documents, we call the `sort()` method on the result set and specify the field to sort by as the first argument. In this example, we sort the documents based on the \"name\" field. The second argument specifies the sorting order, with `pymongo.ASCENDING` representing ascending order and `pymongo.DESCENDING` representing descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then print the sorted documents by iterating over the result sets obtained after sorting in ascending and descending order, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Explain\n",
    "\n",
    " why `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans7: In MongoDB, `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are used to remove documents or entire collections from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_one()`: This method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified condition. If multiple documents match the condition, only the first document encountered is deleted. It is useful when you want to remove a specific document from a collection based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage of `delete_one()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete a single document\n",
    "query = { \"name\": \"John\" }\n",
    "mycol.delete_one(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `delete_one()` method is used to delete a document from the \"customers\" collection that matches the query `{ \"name\": \"John\" }`. It removes the first document that satisfies the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_many()`: This method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified condition. It allows you to remove all the documents that meet the given criteria. It is useful when you want to remove multiple documents based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage of `delete_many()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete multiple documents\n",
    "query = { \"age\": { \"$gte\": 30 } }\n",
    "mycol.delete_many(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `delete_many()` method is used to delete multiple documents from the \"customers\" collection that satisfy the query `{ \"age\": { \"$gte\": 30 } }`. It removes all the documents where the \"age\" field is greater than or equal to 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `drop()`: This method is used to delete an entire collection from the database. It removes all the documents and indexes associated with the collection. It is a more drastic operation compared to `delete_one()` and `delete_many()` as it deletes the entire collection itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage of `drop()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Drop a collection\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "mycol.drop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `drop()` method is used to remove the \"customers\" collection from the \"mydatabase\" database. This operation deletes the entire collection, including all its documents and indexes.\n",
