    "**Q1. Create a vehicle class with an init method having instance variables as name_of_vehicle, max_speed and average_of_vehicle.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle):\n",
    "    self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle\n",
    "    self.max_speed = max_speed\n",
    "    self.average_of_vehicle = average_of_vehicle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a `Vehicle` class with an `__init__` method that takes three arguments: `name_of_vehicle`, `max_speed`, and `average_of_vehicle`. The `__init__` method then assigns these arguments to the instance variables of the `Vehicle` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Create a child class car from the vehicle class created in Que 1, which will inherit the vehicle class.\n",
    "Create a method named seating_capacity which takes capacity as an argument and returns the name of the vehicle and its seating capacity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "  def seating_capacity(self, capacity):\n",
    "    return f\"The name of the vehicle is {self.name_of_vehicle} and its seating capacity is {capacity}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a `Car` class that inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class also defines a method called `seating_capacity` that takes a `capacity` argument and returns the name of the vehicle and its seating capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is multiple inheritance? Write a python code to demonstrate multiple inheritance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. This means that a class can inherit the properties and methods of multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of multiple inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle):\n",
    "    self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle\n",
    "    self.max_speed = max_speed\n",
    "    self.average_of_vehicle = average_of_vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "  def seating_capacity(self, capacity):\n",
    "    return f\"The name of the vehicle is {self.name_of_vehicle} and its seating capacity is {capacity}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Truck(Vehicle):\n",
    "  def carrying_capacity(self, capacity):\n",
    "    return f\"The name of the vehicle is {self.name_of_vehicle} and its carrying capacity is {capacity}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bus(Car, Truck):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle, capacity):\n",
    "    super().__init__(name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle)\n",
    "    self.capacity = capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "  bus = Bus(\"Bus\", 120, 40, 50)\n",
    "  print(bus.seating_capacity(50))\n",
    "  print(bus.carrying_capacity(5000))\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "  main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a `Bus` class that inherits from both the `Car` class and the `Truck` class. The `Bus` class then defines a method called `__init__` that takes four arguments: `name_of_vehicle`, `max_speed`, `average_of_vehicle`, and `capacity`. The `__init__` method then assigns these arguments to the instance variables of the `Bus` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bus` class also defines two methods: `seating_capacity` and `carrying_capacity`. The `seating_capacity` method returns the name of the vehicle and its seating capacity, while the `carrying_capacity` method returns the name of the vehicle and its carrying capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function in the code creates a `Bus` object and then prints the results of calling the `seating_capacity` and `carrying_capacity` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What are getter and setter in python? Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Getters and setters are two special methods that are used to get and set the value of an instance variable. Getters are used to get the value of an instance variable, while setters are used to set the value of an instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of getters and setters in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Method overriding in Python refers to the ability of a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. It allows the subclass to redefine the behavior of the method according to its specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is overridden in the subclass, the version of the method defined in the subclass is used instead of the method inherited from the parent class when the method is called on an object of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code that demonstrates method overriding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Starting the engine\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Starting the car engine\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects of the classes\n",
    "vehicle = Vehicle()\n",
    "car = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call the start_engine method on the objects\n",
    "vehicle.start_engine()  # Output: Starting the engine\n",
    "car.start_engine()  # Output: Starting the car engine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we have a base class `Vehicle` with a `start_engine` method that prints \"Starting the engine\". The `Car` class is a subclass of `Vehicle` and overrides the `start_engine` method with its own implementation, which prints \"Starting the car engine\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an object of the `Vehicle` class and call the `start_engine` method, the version of the method defined in the `Vehicle` class is executed. However, when we create an object of the `Car` class and call the `start_engine` method, the overridden version defined in the `Car` class is executed instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates method overriding, where the subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass, allowing for customization and specialization of behavior."
